## nimbleDistance: functions for fitting distance sampling models in [nimble](https://https://r-nimble.org/)

This repository provides some user-defined distributions that can be used to implement distance sampling models in nimble:

* Includes likelihoods for common distance-detection distributions (hazard-rate and half-normal) using both line-transect and point surveys.

* Includes a vignette illustrating use of the package to undertake some simple analyses of distance-detection data collected on lines and points.

The package is at a very early stage of development. Suggestions for improvement and contributions of code are very welcome.

### Installation:

```
remotes::install_github("scrogster/nimbleDistance")
```
